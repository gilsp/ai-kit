# AI Kit

This jupyter notebook series constitutes a miscellaneous collection of code-snippeds for generic tasks in ML/DL-projects. The purpose is to speed up and ease model development by providing content for copying / pasting / and further customization. Each section constitutes a separat jupyter notebook.

#### A - BASICS
1. **Data Preprocessing** - Imputation, Normalization
2. **Oulier Detection** - Univariate Z-Score, Isolation Forest, Elliptic Envelope, DBSCAN
3. **Dimensionality Reduction** - PCA, tSNE

#### B - MACHINE LEARNING (SkLearn)
1. **Model Selection** - Benchmarking Algorithms with default Hyperparameters
2. **Hyperparamter Tuning** - Random Search, Learning Curves

#### C - DEEP LEARNING (Keras)
1. **Neural Nets** - Keras Sequential Model
2. **CNNs** - from Scratch, Transferlearning
3. **RNNs** - from Scratch, Transferlearning
4. **Complex Model Graphs** - Functional Keras API
